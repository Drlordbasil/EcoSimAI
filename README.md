# EcoSimAI

EcoSimAI is a Python-based ecosystem simulation incorporating artificial intelligence and neural networks to model interactions between various entities like prey, predators, and plants. The simulation runs on a grid where each entity behaves according to AI-driven decisions, evolving over time.

## Features
- **Ecosystem Simulation**: Simulates an ecosystem with different entities (prey, predators, plants, water).
- **AI and Neural Networks**: Utilizes neural networks for decision-making in entities.
- **Evolutionary Aspects**: Includes mutation and reproduction mechanisms in the AI models.
- **Concurrency**: Employs multi-threading for efficient simulation updates.
- **Graphical Representation**: Visualizes the simulation using `matplotlib`.

## Getting Started
To run EcoSimAI, clone this repository and ensure you have the required dependencies installed (see requirements.txt). Execute `ecosystem_simulation.py` to start the simulation.
